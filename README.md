# Very_Large_Extended_Depth_of_Field_Microscopic_3D_Reconstruction_Technology
This is a technology that enables microscopic 3D reconstruction in complex 2D projections with large depth of field.
This research should be locked until the whole result of the research series be finished. I'm sorry, but my mentor told me so.
