# ULDM3R
The tilte "ULDM3R" stands for "Ultra Large Delth of field Microscopic 3D Reconstruction",   
it's a noval technology that make microscopic 3D reconstruction faster and unexpensive.  

It enables microscopic 3D reconstruction in complex 2D projections with large depth of field.  

This research should be locked until the whole result of the research series be finished. I'm sorry, but my mentor told me so.
